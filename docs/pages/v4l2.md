## Description
This interface provides a set of `IOCTL` calls that are required to be supported by the `SoC`'s `V4L2` driver. Any of the layers calling the `V4L2`, should be referred as `caller`.  
The diagram below shows the interaction between `Caller` and `SoC` `V4L2` Driver.

### Introduction
The `V4L2` functionality enables video playback applications to easily display video content on a variety of embedded Linux devices with different video output capabilities. `V4L2` framework provides a standardized and flexible interface for working with video devices on Linux-based systems. By providing a common API for accessing and controlling video devices, `V4L2` simplifies the development of video applications and drivers, and enables interoperability across different hardware platforms and drivers.

For example, when a user-space application requests a video frame, the `V4L2` driver captures the frame from the device using the configured communication channels and stores it in a buffer. The user-space application can then read the frame from the buffer and process it as needed. Similarly, when a user-space application requests output to a display device, the V4L2 driver outputs the video frames to the appropriate destination. During video playback, the video frames are sent to the video output device using the `V4L2` `IOCTL` calls, which handles the low-level details of displaying the frames on the screen.

## Component Runtime Execution Requirements
These requirements ensure that the `HAL` executes correctly within the run-time environment that it will be used in. Failure to meet these requirements will likely result in undefined and unexpected behaviour.

### Initialization and Startup
The `V4L2` driver provides the interface between the `caller` and the video device. Once the `caller` successfully opens the video device file (available as /dev/videoX; where X is a non-negative integer) with read and write permissions (O_RDWR) using the `open`() system call and sets the O_CLOEXEC flag, it will then use subsequent `V4L2`-specific `IOCTL` calls to interact with the driver and perform operations. With `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` the `caller` will get the device hardware capabilities.

### Threading Model
`HAL` is expected to be thread safe. Any `caller` invoking the `API`s should ensure calls are made in a thread safe manner. There is no restriction on the vendor to create any number of threads to meet the operational requirements. 

### Process Model
This interface supports multiple instantiation with a single process. The `V4L2` driver is expected to support multiple opens. `EBUSY` will be returned if the driver does not support multiple opens and the device is already in use. Merely opening a `V4L2` device does not grant exclusive access. Initiating data exchange however assigns the right to read or write the requested type of data, and to change related properties, to this file descriptor. `caller` can request additional access privileges using the priority mechanism. Refer: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/userspace-api/media/v4l/open.html 

### Memory Model
The memory model of this interface needs to be taken care by the `SoC`'s `V4L2` driver only, with respect to the `IOCTL` calls which are required by the `caller`. By utilizing these `IOCTL` calls, `caller` will interact with `V4L2` and manage the memory model for video frames. The choice of memory type will be done by the `caller` and `V4L2` driver should be able to support at least these two memory types: `V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP` and `V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF`.

### Power Management Requirements
There is no requirement for the component to participate in power management. In general, the `SoC` `V4L2` driver should be designed to minimize the power consumption of the device.

### Asynchronous Notification Model
The following `IOCTL` calls, namely `VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT`, `VIDIOC_UNSUBSCRIBE_EVENT`, and `VIDIOC_DQEVENT`, support an asynchronous notification model as they enable the `caller` to receive video events asynchronously, indicating changes or occurrences in the video device or system. Other `IOCTL`s primarily involve configuration, control, streaming, buffer management, or retrieval of information, but they do not have built-in mechanisms for asynchronous event handling or notifications.

1. `VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT`: This `API` call allows `caller` to subscribe to video events generated by a video device asynchronously. Once subscribed, the `caller` can receive notifications about specific events asynchronously, indicating changes or occurrences in the video device.

2. `VIDIOC_UNSUBSCRIBE_EVENT`: This `API` call cancels the subscription to video events previously established using `VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT`. It stops the asynchronous event notifications from being received by the `caller`.

3. `VIDIOC_DQEVENT`: This `API` call dequeues a video event generated by a video device. It allows the `caller` to retrieve the event information asynchronously, indicating the occurrence of a specific event.

The `V4L2` driver is required to support at least these four event types: `V4L2_EVENT_ALL`, `V4L2_EVENT_SRC_CH_RESOLUTION`, `V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE` and `V4L2_EVENT_EOS`. Refer: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4/media/uapi/v4l/vidioc-dqevent.html#event-type 

### Blocking calls
None of the calls in the interface should block.

### Internal Error Handling
All the `API`s must return error synchronously as a return argument. `HAL` is responsible for handling system errors (e.g. out of memory) internally.

### Persistence Model
There is no requirement for the interface to persist any setting information. 


## Non-functional requirements

### Logging and debugging requirements
This interface is required to support DEBUG, INFO and ERROR messages. ERROR logs should be enabled by default. DEBUG and INFO is required to be disabled by default and enabled when needed.

### Memory and performance requirements
This interface is required to not cause excessive memory and CPU utilization.

### Quality Control

- This interface is required to perform static analysis, our preferred tool is Coverity.
- Have a zero-warning policy with regards to compiling. All warnings are required to be treated as error.
- Copyright validation is required to be performed, e.g.: Black duck, FossID.
- Use of memory analysis tools like Valgrind are encouraged, to identify leaks/corruptions.
- `HAL` Tests will endeavour to create worst case scenarios to assist investigations.
- Improvements by any party to the testing suite are required to be fed back.

### Licensing
The `HAL` implementation is expected to released under the Apache License 2.0.

### Build Requirements
`V4L2` driver will be implemented as a kernel module. `SoC` team is expected to handle the compilation of `V4L2` driver as part of kernel and need to enable the configuration options required for adding `V4L2` driver in the kernel for supporting V4L protocol based decoding components. The driver modules plug into the videodev kernel module. Also, the driver's linux kernel is expected to be at least 5.4.0. Refer this link for necessary configuration options: https://www.kernelconfig.io/index.html

The build mechanism should be independent of Yocto.  

### Variability Management
Any changes in the `API`s should be reviewed and approved by the component architects. Further support may be added to test any specific requirements of the target platform or product.

### Platform or Product Customization
No product customization is expected from `SoC` vendors from this module.


## Interface API Documentation
`API` documentation will be provided by Doxygen which will be generated from the header files.

### Theory of operation and key concepts
The `Caller` is expected to have complete control over calling the `V4L2` `IOCTL`s.

- Operation of `V4L2` typically involves the following steps:

1. Device Detection and Opening: The `caller` initiates the process by detecting (using `opendir`() & `readdir`() functions with given full path /dev/videoX) and attempting to open the video device file using the `open`() system call. The operating system's file system layer handles the mapping of the specified device file to the corresponding driver. On success `open`() returns the new file descriptor. On error -1 is returned, and the `errno` variable is set appropriately.The `V4L2` driver, once accessed through the opened device file, provides the necessary interface for the `caller` to communicate with the video device.

2. Device Capabilities Query: After opening the device, `caller` shall query the `V4L2` framework for driver and hardware capabilities using `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP`. The `IOCTL` takes a pointer to a struct `v4l2_capability` which is filled by the driver. When the driver is not compatible with this specification the `IOCTL` returns an `EINVAL` error code. `SoC` `V4L2` driver should support these device capabilities flags: `V4L2_CAP_DEVICE_CAPS`, `V4L2_CAP_STREAMING` and `V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_M2M`/`V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_M2M_MPLANE`.

3. Stream Configuration: To prepare the video device for capturing video data, the `V4L2` interface configures various streaming parameters, such as the desired image format, buffer type and frame sizes. This step ensures that the video device is set up correctly for capturing video in the specified format.

4. Memory Mapping: `V4L2` provides memory mapping mechanisms to efficiently transfer video frames between the video device and the `caller`. This process involves allocating memory buffers in the system, which will be used to store the captured video frames. Once is `VIDIOC_QUERYBUF` is called and the buffer is ready, it will be copied into the enqueue using `VIDIOC_QBUF`.

5. Stream Activation:  Once the device is properly configured and memory buffers are allocated, the `V4L2` interface activates the video stream using `VIDIOC_STREAMON`. This step starts the flow of video frames from the device to the allocated memory buffers, allowing the `caller` to access and process the captured video data.

6. Data Processing and Utilization: Once the video stream is active, the `caller` can retrieve the captured video frames from the memory buffers and process them for various purposes. This may include displaying the video feed on a screen using `VIDIOC_DQBUF`, saving the video to a file, performing real-time analysis, or integrating the video data into other applications.

- For `SoC` Implementation, `V4L2` driver is required to support these 23 `IOCTL` calls:

`VIDIOC_CROPCAP`, `VIDIOC_G_CTRL`, `VIDIOC_S_PARM`, `VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL`, `VIDIOC_S_CTRL`, `VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`, `VIDIOC_STREAMON`, `VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD`, `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP`, `VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT`, `VIDIOC_UNSUBSCRIBE_EVENT`, `VIDIOC_DQEVENT`, `VIDIOC_S_FMT`, `VIDIOC_G_FMT`, `VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES`, `VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT`, `VIDIOC_QUERYBUF`, `VIDIOC_REQBUFS`, `VIDIOC_QBUF`, `VIDIOC_EXPBUF`, `VIDIOC_DQBUF`,`VIDIOC_G_SELECTION`, `VIDIOC_S_EXT_CTRLS`.
